# Changelog

TrixiParticles.jl follows the interpretation of
[semantic versioning (semver)](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/compatibility/#Version-specifier-format-1)
used in the Julia ecosystem. Notable changes will be documented in this file for human readability.

## Version 0.3.1

### Features

- New viscosity models `ViscosityMorrisSGS` and `ViscosityAdamiSGS` were added, which use a simplified Smagorinsky-type SGS (#753).  

- With all CPU backends, a new array type is used for the integration array, which defines
  broadcasting to be multithreaded, leading to speedups of up to 5x with large thread counts
  when combined with thread pinning (#722).

## Version 0.3

### API Changes

- Rescaled the Wendland kernels by a factor of 2 to be consistent with literature.
  This requires adjusting the previously used smoothing length for the Wendland Kernels
  by dividing them by 2 as well to obtain the same results (#775).

- API for custom quantities and functions in the `PostprocessCallback` changed (#755).

- The API for choosing parallelization backends changed. The keyword argument `data_type`
  in `semidiscretize` was removed and a keyword argument `parallelization_backend` was added
  to `Semidiscretization`. See [the docs on GPU support](@ref gpu_support) for more details.

### Features

- **Explicit Contact Models:** Added explicit contact models, `LinearContactModel` and `HertzContactModel`, to the DEM solver. (#756)

- **Particle Shifting Technique (PST) for Closed Systems:** Integrated the
  Particle Shifting Technique to enhance particle distribution, reduce clumping
  and prevent void regions due to tensile instability in closed system simulations. (#735)

- **Open Boundary Model:** Added an open boundary model based on Tafuni et al. (2018),
  utilizing mirroring and extrapolation to transfer fluid quantities to the buffer zones.
  This enhancement allows for more accurate handling of simulation boundaries in open systems,
  ensuring better consistency between the computed domain and its buffer areas. (#574)

- **Transport Velocity Formulation (TVF) for WCSPH Solver:** Added support for TVF
  to the WCSPH solver, improving the consistency and stability
  of weakly compressible SPH simulations. (#600)

### Refactoring

- **Variable Smoothing Length Structures:** Introduced new structures to support a variable
  smoothing length, providing enhanced flexibility in simulation configurations. (#736)

- **Flexible Parallelization Backend:** Improved the parallelization backend support,
  making it possible to switch the parallelization backend for single simulations. (#748)

- **Total Lagrangian SPH:** Added per-particle material parameters. (#740)

## Version 0.2.7

### Features

- Added the classic **Continuum Surface Force (CSF)** model based on Morris 2000 (#584), which computes
  surface tension as a **body force** proportional to curvature and directed along the interface normal.
  This method is efficient and accurate for capillary effects but does not explicitly conserve momentum.

- Added the classic **Continuum Surface Stress (CSS)** model based on Morris 2000 (#584), which is
  a **momentum-conserving** approach that formulates surface tension as the **divergence of a stress tensor**.
  However, it requires additional computation and stabilization to handle **high-density interfaces** and reduce numerical instabilities.

- Added `BoundaryZone` to allow for bidirectional flow (#623)

- Added the symplectic time integration scheme used in DualSPHysics (#716)

### Documentation

- Added documentation for time integration (#716)

### Testing

- Run CI tests on GPUs via Buildkite CI (#723)

### Bugs

- Fix GPU computations (#689)

## Version 0.2.6

### Features

- Support for surface tension was added to EDAC (#539)

### Refactored

- Surface normal calculation was moved from `surface_tension.jl` to `surface_normal_sph.jl` (#539)

## Version 0.2.5

### Features

- Add particle packing for 2D (.asc) and 3D (.stl) geometries (#529)

### Compatibility Changes

- Dropped support for Julia 1.9

## Version 0.2.4

### Features

- A method to prevent penetration of fast moving particles with solids was added (#498)
- Added the callback `SteadyStateReachedCallback` to detect convergence of static simulations (#601)
- Added ideal gas state equation (#607)
- Simulations can be run with `Float32` (#662)

### Documentation

- Documentation for GPU support was added (#660)
- A new user tutorial was added (#514)
- Several docs fixes (#663, #659, #637, #658, #664)
