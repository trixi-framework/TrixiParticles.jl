# 3D Particle Packing within a Complex Geometry (e.g., Sphere STL)
#
# This example demonstrates 3D particle packing by leveraging the 2D packing script
# (`packing_2d.jl`). It loads a 3D geometry (STL file), sets 3D-specific parameters,
# and then includes the 2D script, which will perform the packing logic adapted
# for 3D.

# The following depends on the sampling of the particles. In this case `boundary_thickness`
# means literally the thickness of the boundary packed with boundary particles and *not*
# how many rows of boundary particles will be sampled.
