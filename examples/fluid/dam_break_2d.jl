# with large time steps. Close to the wall, the stepsize has to be reduced drastically.
# Sometimes, the method fails to do so with Monaghan-Kajtar BC because forces
# become extremely large when fluid particles are very close to boundary particles,
# and the time integration method interprets this as an instability.
