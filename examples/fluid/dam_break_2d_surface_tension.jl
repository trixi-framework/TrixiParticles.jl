# Set the surface tension to a value that is accurate in your case.
# Note: This usually requires calibration to be physically accurate!
surface_tension = SurfaceTensionAkinci(surface_tension_coefficient=0.025)

# `density_diffusion` is deactivated since the interaction with the surface tension model can
# cause stability problems.
# `adhesion_coefficient` needs to be set to a value so that the fluid doesn't separate
# from the boundary.
# Note: The surface tension model leads to an increase in compressibility of the fluid,
#       which needs to be rectified by an increase of the `sound_speed`.
# Note: The Wendland Kernels don't work very well here since the `SurfaceTensionAkinci`
#       model is optimized for a compact support of `2 * particle_spacing`, which would result
#       in a too small `smoothing_length` for the Wendland Kernel functions.
# Note: Adhesion will result in additional friction at the boundary.
