    SpatialHashingSearch{NDIMS}(search_radius, n_particles)

Simple grid-based neighborhood search with uniform search radius ``d``,
inspired by (Ihmsen et al. 2011, Section 4.4).

The domain is divided into cells of uniform size ``d`` in each dimension.
Only particles in neighboring cells are then considered as neighbors of a particle.
Instead of representing a finite domain by an array of cells (basic uniform grid),
a potentially infinite domain is represented by saving cells in a hash table,
indexed by the cell index tuple
```math
\left( \left\lfloor \frac{x}{d} \right\rfloor, \left\lfloor \frac{y}{d} \right\rfloor \right) \quad \text{or} \quad
\left( \left\lfloor \frac{x}{d} \right\rfloor, \left\lfloor \frac{y}{d} \right\rfloor, \left\lfloor \frac{z}{d} \right\rfloor \right),
```
where ``x, y, z`` are the space coordinates.

As opposed to (Ihmsen et al. 2011), we do not handle the hashing explicitly and use
Julia's `Dict` data structure instead.
We also do not sort the particles in any way, since that makes our implementation
a lot faster (although not parallelizable).
