    GridNeighborhoodSearch{NDIMS}(search_radius, n_particles)

Simple grid-based neighborhood search with uniform search radius ``d``.
The domain is divided into a regular grid.
For each (non-empty) grid cell, a list of particles in this cell is stored.
Instead of representing a finite domain by an array of cells, a potentially infinite domain
is represented by storing cell lists in a hash table (using Julia's `Dict` data structure),
indexed by the cell index tuple
```math
\left( \left\lfloor \frac{x}{d} \right\rfloor, \left\lfloor \frac{y}{d} \right\rfloor \right) \quad \text{or} \quad
\left( \left\lfloor \frac{x}{d} \right\rfloor, \left\lfloor \frac{y}{d} \right\rfloor, \left\lfloor \frac{z}{d} \right\rfloor \right),
```
where ``x, y, z`` are the space coordinates.

To find particles within a radius around a point, only particles in the neighboring cells
are considered.

See also (Chalela et al., 2021), (Ihmsen et al. 2011, Section 4.4).

As opposed to (Ihmsen et al. 2011), we do not sort the particles in any way,
since that makes our implementation a lot faster (although less parallelizable).
