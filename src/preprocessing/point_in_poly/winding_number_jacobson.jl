Algorithm for inside-outside segmentation of a complex geometry proposed by [Jacobson2013](@cite).

# Keywords
- `geometry`: Complex geometry returned by [`load_geometry`](@ref) and is only required when using
              `hierarchical_winding=true`.
- `hierarchical_winding`: If set to `true`, an optimized hierarchical approach will be used,
                          which gives a significant speedup. For further information see [Hierarchical Winding](@ref hierarchical_winding).
- `winding_number_factor`: For leaky geometries, a factor of `0.4` will give a better inside-outside segmentation.

!!! warning "Experimental Implementation"
    This is an experimental feature and may change in any future releases.
