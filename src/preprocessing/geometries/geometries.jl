"""
    planar_geometry_to_face(planar_geometry::TriangleMesh)

Extracts a simplified rectangular face and its normal vector from an arbitrary planar geometry
(`TriangleMesh` loaded via [`load_geometry`](@ref))
for use as a boundary zone interface in [`BoundaryZone`](@ref).
This function computes the corner points of an oriented bounding box
that best represents the essential orientation and extent of the input geometry.
The geometry must be planar (all vertices should lie in the same plane),
but can have complex or non-rectangular boundaries.

!!! note "Face Normal Orientation"
    All face normals of the input geometry must point inside the fluid domain.
    The returned plane normal is computed by averaging all face normals, so consistent orientation is required.

# Arguments
- `planar_geometry`: A planar geometry (`TriangleMesh` loaded via [`load_geometry`](@ref)).

# Returns
- `face_vertices`: Tuple of three vertices defining the rectangular face (corner points of the oriented bounding box).
- `face_normal`: Normalized normal vector of the face.

# Example
```jldoctest; output=false, filter=r"face = .*"
file = pkgdir(TrixiParticles, "test", "preprocessing", "data")
planar_geometry = load_geometry(joinpath(file, "inflow_geometry.stl"))

face, face_normal = planar_geometry_to_face(planar_geometry)

# output
(face = ...)
```
