    SymplecticPositionVerlet()

Modified leapfrog integration scheme for Weakly Compressible SPH (WCSPH) when integrating
the density with [`ContinuityDensity`](@ref).
This scheme is used by the SPH code [DualSPHysics](https://github.com/DualSPHysics/DualSPHysics).
See
[https://github.com/DualSPHysics/DualSPHysics/wiki/3.-SPH-formulation#372-symplectic-position-verlet-scheme]

and [Dom√≠nguez et al. 2022, Section 2.5.2](@cite Dominguez2022).

See [time integration](@ref time_integration) for more details.
