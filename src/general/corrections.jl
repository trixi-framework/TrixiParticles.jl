    ShepardKernelCorrection()

Kernel correction uses Shepard interpolation to obtain a 0-th order accurate result, which
was first proposed by Li et al.

The kernel correction coefficient is determined by
```math
c(x) = \sum_{b=1}^{N} V_b W_b(x)
```

This correction is applied with SummationDensity to correct the density and leads to an improvement
as especially for free surfaces.
