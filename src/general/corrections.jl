    AkinciFreeSurfaceCorrection(rho0)

Free surface correction according to Akinci et al. (2013).
At a free surface, the mean density is typically lower than the reference density,
resulting in reduced surface tension and viscosity forces.
The free surface correction adjusts the viscosity, pressure, and surface tension forces
near free surfaces to counter this effect.
It's important to note that this correlation is unphysical and serves as an approximation.
The computation time added by this method is about 2-3%.

# Arguments
- `rho0`: Reference density.

    ShepardKernelCorrection()

Kernel correction uses Shepard interpolation to obtain a 0-th order accurate result, which
was first proposed by Li et al.

The kernel correction coefficient is determined by
```math
c(x) = \sum_{b=1}^{N} V_b W_b(x)
```

This correction is applied with SummationDensity to correct the density and leads to an improvement
as especially for free surfaces.

# Notes
- Also referred to as 0th order correction (2D: +5-6% computational time)
