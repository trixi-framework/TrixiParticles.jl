    AkinciFreeSurfaceCorrection(rho0)

Free surface correction according to Akinci et al. (2013).
At a free surface, the mean density is typically lower than the reference density,
resulting in reduced surface tension and viscosity forces.
The free surface correction adjusts the viscosity, pressure, and surface tension forces
near free surfaces to counter this effect.
It's important to note that this correlation is unphysical and serves as an approximation.
The computation time added by this method is about 2-3%.

# Arguments
- `rho0`: Reference density.

    ShepardKernelCorrection()

Kernel correction uses Shepard interpolation to obtain a 0-th order accurate result, which
was first proposed by Li et al.

The kernel correction coefficient is determined by
```math
c(x) = \sum_{b=1}^{N} V_b W_b(x)
```

This correction is applied with SummationDensity to correct the density and leads to an improvement
as especially for free surfaces.

# Notes
- Also referred to as 0th order correction (2D: +5-6% computational time)

    KernelGradientCorrection()

Kernel gradient correction uses Shepard interpolation to obtain a 0-th order accurate result, which
was first proposed by Li et al. This can be further extended to obtain a kernel corrected gradient
as shown by Basa et al.

The kernel correction coefficient is determined by
```math
c(x) = \sum_{b=1}^{N} V_b W_b(x)
```
The gradient of corrected kernel is determined by
```math
\nabla \tilde(W)_{b}(x) = \frac{\naba W_{b}(x) - \gamma(x)}{\sum_{b=1}^{N} V_b W_b(x)}
\gamma(x) = \frac{\sum_{b=1}^{N} V_b \nabla W_b(x)}{\sum_{b=1}^{N} V_b W_b(x)}
```

This correction can be applied with SummationDensity and ContinuityDensity which leads to an improvement
especially for free surfaces.

# Notes
- This only works when the boundary model uses `SummationDensity` (yet).
- It is also referred to as 0th order correction.
- In 2D, we can expect an increase of about 10-15% in computation time.

    GradientCorrection()

Compute the corrected gradient of particle interactions based on their relative positions.

# Mathematical Details

Given the standard SPH representation, the gradient of a field A at particle i is given by:

```math
\nabla A_a = \sum_b m_b \frac{A_b - A_a}{\rho_b} \nabla_{r_a} W(\Vert r_a - r_b \Vert, h)
```

Where:
- $m_b$ is the mass of particle $b$.
- $rho_b$ is the density of particle $b$.

The gradient correction, as commonly proposed, involves multiplying this gradient with a correction matrix $L$:

```math
\nabla^\tilde A_i = L_i \nabla A_i
```

The correction matrix  $L_i$ is computed based on the provided particle configuration,
aiming to make the corrected gradient more accurate, especially near domain boundaries.

# Notes:
- Stability issues as especially when particles separate into small clusters.
- Doubles the computational effort.
