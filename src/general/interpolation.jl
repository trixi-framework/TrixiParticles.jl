    interpolate_line(start, end_, no_points, semi, ref_system, sol; endpoint=true, smoothing_length=ref_system.smoothing_length)

Interpolates properties along a line in an SPH simulation environment.
The line is defined by its start and end points, and the number of points to interpolate along this line is specified.
The function can optionally include or exclude the line's endpoint in the interpolation process.

The line interpolation is accomplished by generating a series of evenly spaced points between `start` and `end_`.
The number of these points is determined by `no_points`. When `endpoint` is `true`, both the start and end points are included in the interpolation.
If `endpoint` is `false`, the line is interpolated between the start and end points but does not include these points.

The function relies on the existing `interpolate_point` function for performing the actual interpolation at each point.

### Parameters:
- `start`: The starting point of the line.
- `end_`: The ending point of the line.
- `no_points`: The number of points to interpolate along the line.
- `semi`: The semidiscretization used for the simulation.
- `ref_system`: The reference system for the interpolation.
- `sol`: The solution state from which the properties are interpolated.
- `endpoint`: Optional. A boolean to include (`true`) or exclude (`false`) the end point in the interpolation. Default is `true`.
- `smoothing_length`: Optional. The smoothing length used in the interpolation. Default is `ref_system.smoothing_length`.

### Returns:
An array of interpolated properties at each point along the line.

!!! note
    - This function is particularly useful for analyzing gradients or creating visualizations along a specified line in the SPH simulation domain.
    - The interpolation accuracy is subject to the density of particles and the chosen smoothing length.

## Example
```julia
# Interpolating along a line from [1.0, 0.0] to [1.0, 1.0] with 5 points
results = interpolate_line([1.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0], 5, semi, ref_system, sol)
```

    interpolate_point(points_coords::Array{Array{Float64,1},1}, semi, ref_system, sol; smoothing_length=ref_system.smoothing_length)

    interpolate_point(point_coords, semi, ref_system, sol; smoothing_length=ref_system.smoothing_length)

Performs interpolation of properties at specified points or an array of points in an SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics) simulation.
This function can handle either a single point or multiple points.

When given an array of points (`points_coords`), it iterates over each point and applies interpolation individually.
For a single point (`point_coords`), it performs the interpolation at that specific location.
The interpolation is based on the SPH method, utilizing a kernel function to weigh contributions from nearby particles.

### Parameters:
- `points_coords`: An array of points (each being an Array{Float64,1}) for which to interpolate properties.
- `point_coords`: The coordinates of a single point (Array{Float64,1}) for interpolation.
- `semi`: The semidiscretization used in the SPH simulation.
- `ref_system`: The reference system defining the properties of the SPH particles.
- `sol`: The current solution state from which properties are interpolated.
- `smoothing_length`: Optional. The smoothing length used in the kernel function. Defaults to `ref_system.smoothing_length`.

### Returns:
- For multiple points: An array of results, each containing the interpolated property (e.g., density), the neighbor count, and the coordinates of the point.
- For a single point: A tuple containing the interpolated property, the neighbor count, and the coordinates of the point.

### Usage:
```julia
# For a single point
result = interpolate_point([1.0, 0.5], semi, ref_system, sol)

# For multiple points
points = [[1.0, 0.5], [1.0, 0.6], [1.0, 0.7]]
results = interpolate_point(points, semi, ref_system, sol)
```
!!! note
- The accuracy of interpolation depends on the local particle density and the smoothing length.
- This function is particularly useful for extracting physical properties at specific locations within the SPH simulation domain.
