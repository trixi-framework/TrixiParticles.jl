Interpolates properties along a plane in a TrixiParticles simulation.
The region for interpolation is defined by its lower left and top right corners,
with a specified resolution determining the density of the interpolation points.

The function generates a grid of points within the defined region,
spaced uniformly according to the given resolution.

# Arguments
- `min_corner`: The lower left corner of the interpolation region.
- `max_corner`: The top right corner of the interpolation region.
- `resolution`: The distance between adjacent interpolation points in the grid.
- `semi`:       The semidiscretization used for the simulation.
- `ref_system`: The reference system for the interpolation.
- `sol`:        The solution state from which the properties are interpolated.

# Keywords
- `smoothing_length=ref_system.smoothing_length`: The smoothing length used in the interpolation.
- `cut_off_bnd=true`: Boolean to indicate if quantities should be set to `NaN` when the point
                      is "closer" to the boundary than to the fluid in a kernel-weighted sense.
                      Or, in more detail, when the boundary has more influence than the fluid
                      on the density summation in this point, i.e., when the boundary particles
                      add more kernel-weighted mass than the fluid particles.
- `clip_negative_pressure=false`: One common approach in SPH models is to clip negative pressure
                                  values, but this is unphysical. Instead we clip here during

# Returns
- A `NamedTuple` of arrays containing interpolated properties at each point within the plane.

!!! note
    - The interpolation accuracy is subject to the density of particles and the chosen smoothing length.
    - With `cut_off_bnd`, a density-based estimation of the surface is used, which is not as

Performs interpolation of properties at specified points or an array of points in a TrixiParticles simulation.

When given an array of points (`points_coords`), it iterates over each point and applies interpolation individually.
For a single point (`point_coords`), it performs the interpolation at that specific location.
The interpolation utilizes the same kernel function of the SPH simulation to weigh contributions from nearby particles.

# Arguments
- `points_coords`:  An array of point coordinates, for which to interpolate properties.
- `point_coords`:   The coordinates of a single point for interpolation.
- `semi`:           The semidiscretization used in the SPH simulation.
- `ref_system`:     The reference system defining the properties of the SPH particles.
- `sol`:            The current solution state from which properties are interpolated.

# Keywords
- `smoothing_length=ref_system.smoothing_length`: The smoothing length used in the interpolation.
- `cut_off_bnd=true`: Boolean to indicate if quantities should be set to `NaN` when the point
                      is "closer" to the boundary than to the fluid in a kernel-weighted sense.
                      Or, in more detail, when the boundary has more influence than the fluid
                      on the density summation in this point, i.e., when the boundary particles
                      add more kernel-weighted mass than the fluid particles.
- `clip_negative_pressure=false`: One common approach in SPH models is to clip negative pressure
                                  values, but this is unphysical. Instead we clip here during
                                  interpolation thus only impacting the local interpolated value.

# Returns
- For multiple points:  A `NamedTuple` of arrays containing interpolated properties at each point.
- For a single point: A `NamedTuple` of interpolated properties at the point.

# Examples
```jldoctest; output = false, filter = r"density = .*", setup = :(trixi_include(@__MODULE__, joinpath(examples_dir(), "fluid", "hydrostatic_water_column_2d.jl"), tspan=(0.0, 0.01), callbacks=nothing); ref_system = fluid_system)
# For a single point
result = interpolate_point([1.0, 0.5], semi, ref_system, sol)

# For multiple points
points = [[1.0, 0.5], [1.0, 0.6], [1.0, 0.7]]
results = interpolate_point(points, semi, ref_system, sol)

# output
(density = ...)
```
!!! note
    - This function is particularly useful for analyzing gradients or creating visualizations
      along a specified line in the SPH simulation domain.
    - The interpolation accuracy is subject to the density of particles and the chosen smoothing length.
    - With `cut_off_bnd`, a density-based estimation of the surface is used which is not as
    accurate as a real surface reconstruction.
