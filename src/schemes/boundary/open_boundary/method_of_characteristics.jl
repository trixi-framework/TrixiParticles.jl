    BoundaryModelCharacteristicsLastiwka(; extrapolate_reference_values=nothing)

Boundary model for [`OpenBoundarySystem`](@ref).
This model uses the characteristic variables to propagate the appropriate values
to the outlet or inlet and was proposed by Lastiwka et al. (2009).
It requires a specific flow direction to be passed to the [`BoundaryZone`](@ref).
For more information about the method see [description below](@ref method_of_characteristics).

# Keywords
- `extrapolate_reference_values=nothing`: If one of the following mirroring methods is selected,
  the reference values are extrapolated from the fluid domain to the boundary particles:
    - [`ZerothOrderMirroring`](@ref)
    - [`FirstOrderMirroring`](@ref)
    - [`SimpleMirroring`](@ref)

  **Note:** This feature is experimental and has not been fully validated yet.
  As of now, we are not aware of any published literature supporting its use.
  Note that even without this extrapolation feature,
  the reference values don't need to be prescribed - they're computed from the characteristics.
