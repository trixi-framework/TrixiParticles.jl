to suppress pairing and tensile instability.
See [TVF](@ref transport_velocity_formulation) for more details of the method.

# Arguments
- `background_pressure`: Background pressure. Suggested is a background pressure which is
                         on the order of the reference pressure.

            #   v_{1/2} = v_0 + Δt/2 * a,

            # is the transport velocity.
            # We call δv_{1/2} = ̃v_{1/2} - v_{1/2} the shifting velocity.
            # We will call δv_{1/2} the shifting velocity, which is given by
            #   δv = -Δt/2 * p_0 / m_a * \sum_b[ (V_a^2 + V_b^2) * ∇W_ab ],
            # where p_0 is the background pressure, V_a = m_a / ρ_a, V_b = m_b / ρ_b.
            # This term depends on the pressure acceleration formulation.
            # In Zhang et al. (2017), the pressure acceleration term
            #   m_b * (p_a / ρ_a^2 + p_b / ρ_b^2) * ∇W_ab
            # is used. They consequently changed the shifting velocity to
            #   δv = -Δt/2 * p_0 * \sum_b[ m_b * (1 / ρ_a^2 + 1 / ρ_b^2) * ∇W_ab ].
            # We therefore use the function `pressure_acceleration` to compute the
            # shifting velocity according to the used pressure acceleration formulation.
            # In most cases, this will be
            #   δv = -Δt/2 * p_0 * \sum_b[ m_b * (1 + 1) / (ρ_a * ρ_b) * ∇W_ab ].
            #
            # In these papers, the shifting velocity is scaled by the time step Δt.
            # We generally want the spatial discretization to be independent of the time step.
            # Scaling the shifting velocity by the time step would lead to less shifting
            # when very small time steps are used for testing/debugging purposes.
            # This is especially problematic in TrixiParticles.jl, as the time step can vary
            # significantly between different time integration methods (low vs high order).
            # In order to eliminate the time step from the shifting velocity, we apply the
            # CFL condition used in Adami et al. (2013):
            #   Δt <= 0.25 * h / c,
            # where h is the smoothing length and c is the sound speed.
            # Applying this equation as equality yields the shifting velocity
            #   δv = -p_0 / 8 * h / c * \sum_b[ m_b * (1 + 1) / (ρ_a * ρ_b) * ∇W_ab ].
            # The last part is achieved by passing `p_a = 1` and `p_b = 1` to the
            # `pressure_acceleration` function.
