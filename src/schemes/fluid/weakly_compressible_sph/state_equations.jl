Equation of state to describe the relationship between pressure and density
of water up to high pressures by Cole (Cole 1948, pp. 39 and 43).
The pressure ``p`` is calculated as
```math
    p = B \left(\left(\frac{\rho}{\rho_0}\right)^\gamma - 1\right) + p_{\text{background}},
```
where ``\rho`` denotes the density, ``\rho_0`` the reference density,
and ``p_{\text{background}}`` the background pressure, which is set to zero when applied to
free-surface flows (Adami et al., 2012).

The bulk modulus, ``B =  \frac{\rho_0 c^2}{\gamma}``, is calculated from the artificial
speed of sound ``c`` and the isentropic exponent ``\gamma``.

An ideal gas equation of state with a linear relationship between pressure and density can
be obtained by choosing `exponent=1`, i.e.
```math
    p = B \left( \frac{\rho}{\rho_0} -1 \right) = c^2(\rho - \rho_0).
```

For higher Reynolds numbers, `exponent=7` is recommended, whereas at lower Reynolds
numbers `exponent=1` yields more accurate pressure estimates since pressure and
density are proportional.

When using [`SummationDensity`](@ref) (or [`DensityReinitializationCallback`](@ref))
and free surfaces, initializing particles with equal spacing will cause underestimated
density and therefore strong attractive forces between particles at the free surface.
Setting `clip_negative_pressure=true` can avoid this.

# Keywords
- `sound_speed`: Artificial speed of sound.
- `reference_density`: Reference density of the fluid.
- `exponent`: A value of `7` is usually used for most simulations.
- `background_pressure=0.0`: Background pressure.
