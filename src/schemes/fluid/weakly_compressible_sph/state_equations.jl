This variant of [`StateEquationCole`](@ref) is adaptive, allowing the speed of sound to be
updated during a simulation.
While a constant higher speed of sound more effectively reduces compressibility effects,
the runtime also scales with the speed of sound.
This state equation aims to reduce runtime compared to a constant higher speed of sound,
while maintaining the advantages of a higher speed of sound.
The speed of sound is initialized as average_velocity / mach_number.

# Keywords
- `mach_number=0.1`: The Mach number of the fluid flow, used to initialize the speed of sound.
- `average_velocity=1.0`: The estimated average velocity of the fluid.
- `reference_density`: Reference density of the fluid.
- `max_sound_speed=100.0`: The maximum permissible speed of sound.
- `exponent`: An exponent, typically 7 for water simulations.
- `background_pressure=0.0`: A constant background pressure.
- `clip_negative_pressure=false`: When true, negative pressure values are clipped to 0.0. This can prevent spurious surface tension effects but might allow for unphysical fluid rarefaction.
