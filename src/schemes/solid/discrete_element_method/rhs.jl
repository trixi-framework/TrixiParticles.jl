    compute_local_contact(particle_pos, boundary_positions, effective_radius)

Given the DEM particle’s position `particle_pos` (an AbstractVector with 2 elements)
and a vector of neighboring boundary particle positions (`boundary_positions`, each
an SVector{2, T}), along with the effective radius used for rounding the boundary,
this function computes:
  - cp_effective: the effective contact point on the boundary,
  - normal: the unit contact normal (pointing from the boundary toward the particle).

It does so by sorting the boundary positions by their polar angle relative to `particle_pos`,
selecting the two “closest” in angle, fitting a local line (tangent) through them, projecting
the DEM particle onto that line, and offsetting the projection by `effective_radius` along the normal.
