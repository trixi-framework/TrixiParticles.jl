# Calculate the interaction forces between particles in a Discrete Element Method (DEM) system.
#
# This function loops over all pairs of particles and their neighbors within a set distance.
# When particles overlap (i.e., they come into contact), a normal force is applied to resolve the overlap.
# This force is computed based on Hertzian contact mechanics typical for DEM simulations.
# The force is proportional to the amount of overlap and is directed along the normal between the particle centers.
# The magnitude of the force is determined by the stiffness constant `normal_stiffness` and the overlap distance.
