    HertzContactModel(; elastic_modulus, poissons_ratio)

Non-linear contact model based on Hertzian contact theory ([DiRenzo2004](@cite)).

This model calculates the normal contact force between two spherical particles (or a particle
and a boundary represented by an equivalent sphere) based on their material properties and
the overlap ``\delta``. The elastic part of the force is given by:
```math
F_{\text{elastic}} = \frac{4}{3} E^* \sqrt{R^*} \delta^{3/2},
```
where ``E^*`` is the effective Young's modulus and ``R^*`` is the effective radius.

The effective Young's modulus ``E^*`` is calculated from the Young's moduli ``E_a, E_b``
and Poisson's ratios ``\nu_a, \nu_b`` of the two contacting bodies:
```math
E^* = \left( \frac{1 - \nu_a^2}{E_a} + \frac{1 - \nu_b^2}{E_b} \right)^{-1}.
```

The effective radius ``R^*`` is calculated from the radii of the two particles ``R_a`` and  ``R_b``:
```math
R^* = \left( \frac{1}{R_a} + \frac{1}{R_b} \right)^{-1} = \frac{R_a R_b}{R_a + R_b}.
```
For particle-wall interactions, ``R_b \to \infty``, so ``R^* = R_a``.

The implementation also includes a damping force based on the approach described in
[DiRenzo2004](@cite), proportional to the normal component of the relative velocity
``v_{\text{rel,n}}``:
```math
F_{\text{damping}} = C_{\text{damp}} \gamma_c v_{\text{rel,n}},
```
where ``C_{\text{damp}}`` is the user-provided damping coefficient (damping ratio), and
``\gamma_c`` is a non-linear critical damping coefficient:
```math
\gamma_c = 2 \sqrt{m^* K_{\text{nonlin}}}
```
with ``m^*`` being the effective mass and ``K_{\text{nonlin}}`` being a non-linear stiffness term
related to the current state:
```math
K_{\text{nonlin}} = \frac{F_{\text{elastic}}}{\delta} = \frac{4}{3} E^* \sqrt{R^* \delta}.
```

The total normal force is ``F_n = F_{\text{elastic}} + F_{\text{damping}}``.

    LinearContactModel(; normal_stiffness)

Linear spring-dashpot contact model ([Cundall1979](@cite)).

This model calculates the normal contact force between two objects based on a linear spring
law for the elastic component and a linear viscous damping law for the dissipative component.
The total normal force ``F_n`` is given by
```math
F_n = k_n \delta + \gamma_d v_{\text{rel,n}},
```
where ``k_n`` is the normal stiffness, ``\delta`` is the overlap between the objects,
``v_{\text{rel,n}}`` is the normal component of the relative velocity, and ``\gamma_d``
is the damping coefficient.

The damping coefficient ``\gamma_d`` is calculated based on the critical damping
coefficient ``\gamma_c`` and a user-provided damping ratio ``C_{\text{damp}}``:
```math
\gamma_d = C_{\text{damp}} \gamma_c,
```
where the critical damping for this linear system is
```math
\gamma_c = 2 \sqrt{m^* k_n}
```
and ``m^*`` is the effective mass of the colliding pair.

The total force is applied along the normal direction connecting the centers of the
contacting objects.
