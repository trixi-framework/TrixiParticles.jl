Rectangular shape filled with particles. Returns an [`InitialCondition`](@ref).

# Arguments
- `particle_spacing`:           Spacing between the particles.
- `n_particles_per_dimension`:  Tuple containing the number of particles in x, y and z
                                (only 3D) direction, respectively.
- `min_coordinates`:            Coordinates of the corner in negative coordinate directions.
- `density`:                    Rest density of the particles.

# Keywords
- `init_velocity`:  The initial velocity of the fluid particles as `(vel_x, vel_y)`
                    (or `(vel_x, vel_y, vel_z)` in 3D).
- `pressure`:       Scalar to set the pressure of all particles to this value.
                    This is only used by the [`EntropicallyDampedSPHSystem`](@ref) and
                    will be overwritten when using an initial pressure function in the system.
- `acceleration`:   In order to initialize particles with a hydrostatic pressure gradient,
                    an acceleration vector can be passed. Note that only accelerations
                    in one coordinate direction and no diagonal accelerations are supported.
                    This will only change the pressure of the particles. When using the
                    [`WeaklyCompressibleSPHSystem`](@ref), pass a `state_equation` as well
                    to initialize the particles with the corresponding density and mass.
                    When using the [`EntropicallyDampedSPHSystem`](@ref), the pressure
                    will be overwritten when using an initial pressure function in the system.
- `state_equation`: When calculating a hydrostatic pressure gradient by setting `acceleration`,
                    the `state_equation` will be used to set the corresponding density and mass.
- `tlsph`:          With the [`TotalLagrangianSPHSystem`](@ref), particles need to be placed
                    on the boundary of the shape and not one particle radius away, as for fluids.
                    When `tlsph=true`, particles will be placed on the boundary of the shape.
