Generate a sphere that is either completely filled (by default)
or hollow (by passing `n_layers`).

With the sphere type [`VoxelSphere`](@ref), a sphere of voxels (where particles are placed
in the voxel center) with a regular inner structure but corners on the surface is created.
Essentially, a grid of particles is generated and all particles outside the sphere are removed.
With the sphere type [`RoundSphere`](@ref), a perfectly round sphere with an imperfect inner
structure is created.

A cuboid can be cut out of the sphere by specifying the two corners in negative and positive
coordinate directions as `cutout_min` and `cutout_max`.

# Arguments
- `particle_spacing`:   Spacing between the particles.
- `radius`:             Radius of the sphere.
- `center_position`:    The coordinates of the center of the sphere.
- `density`:            Either a function mapping each particle's coordinates to its density,
                        or a scalar for a constant density over all particles.

# Keywords
- `sphere_type`:    Either [`VoxelSphere`](@ref) or [`RoundSphere`](@ref) (see
                    explanation above).
- `n_layers`:       Set to an integer greater than zero to generate a hollow sphere,
                    where the shell consists of `n_layers` layers.
- `layer_outwards`: When set to `false` (by default), `radius` is the outer radius
                    of the sphere. When set to `true`, `radius` is the inner radius
                    of the sphere. This is only used when `n_layers > 0`.
- `cutout_min`:     Corner in negative coordinate directions of a cuboid that is to be
                    cut out of the sphere.
- `cutout_max`:     Corner in positive coordinate directions of a cuboid that is to be
                    cut out of the sphere.
- `tlsph`:          With the [`TotalLagrangianSPHSystem`](@ref), particles need to be placed
                    on the boundary of the shape and not one particle radius away, as for fluids.
                    When `tlsph=true`, particles will be placed on the boundary of the shape.
- `velocity`:   Either a function mapping each particle's coordinates to its velocity,
                or, for a constant fluid velocity, a vector holding this velocity.
                Velocity is constant zero by default.
- `mass`:       Either `nothing` (default) to automatically compute particle mass from particle
                density and spacing, or a function mapping each particle's coordinates to its mass,
                or a scalar for a constant mass over all particles.
- `pressure`:   Either a function mapping each particle's coordinates to its pressure,
                or a scalar for a constant pressure over all particles. This is optional and
                only needed when using the [`EntropicallyDampedSPHSystem`](@ref).

Essentially, a grid of particles is generated and all particles outside the sphere are removed.

Construct a sphere (or sphere segment) by nesting perfectly round concentric spheres.

# Keywords
- `start_angle`: The starting angle of the sphere segment in radians. It determines the

- `end_angle`: The ending angle of the sphere segment in radians. It defines the termination
               point of the segment. The default is set to `2pi`, completing a full sphere.

!!! note "Usage"
