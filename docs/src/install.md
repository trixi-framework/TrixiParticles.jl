# Installation

## Setting up Julia
If you have not yet installed Julia, please [follow the instructions for your
operating system](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/). TrixiParticles.jl works
with Julia v1.9 and newer. We recommend using the latest stable release of Julia.

## Installation for users


## [Installation for developers](@id for-developers)
If you plan on editing TrixiParticles.jl itself, you can download TrixiParticles.jl to a local folder and use the
code from the cloned directory:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:trixi-framework/TrixiParticles.jl.git
cd TrixiParticles.jl
mkdir run
julia --project=run -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.develop(PackageSpec(path=".."))' # Install locally
julia --project=run -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add("OrdinaryDiffEq")' # Add TrixiParticles.jl to `run` project
```

If you installed TrixiParticles.jl this way, you always have to start Julia with the `--project`
flag set to your `run` directory, e.g.,
```bash
julia --project=run
```
from the TrixiParticles.jl root directory.

The advantage of using a separate `run` directory is that you can also add other
related packages (e.g., OrdinaryDiffEq.jl, see above) to the project in the `run` folder
and always have a reproducible environment at hand to share with others.

## Optional Software/Packages
- [OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl) -- a Julia package of ordinary differential equation solvers that is used in the examples
- [Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl) -- Julia Plotting library that is used in some examples
- [PythonPlot.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PythonPlot.jl) -- Plotting library that can be used instead of Plots.jl
- [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/) -- Software that can be used for visualization of results
