## Using ParaView

We can now view these files by opening them in ParaView:

1. Click file open
2. Navigate to the out directory
3. Open both "boundary_1.pvd" and "fluid_1.pvd"
4. Click "Apply" which by default is on the left pane below the "Pipeline Browser"
5. To move the solution around **hold the left mouse button**

You will now see the following:

To now view the result variables **first** make sure you have "fluid_1.pvd" highlighted in the "Pipeline Browser" then select them in the variable selection combo box (see picture below).
Lets, for example pick "density". To now view the time progression of the result hit the "play button" (see picture below).
