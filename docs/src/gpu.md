# [GPU Support](@id gpu_support)

GPU support is still an experimental feature that is actively being worked on.
Currently, the [`WeaklyCompressibleSPHSystem`](@ref), [`TotalLagrangianSPHSystem`](@ref)
and [`BoundarySPHSystem`](@ref) support GPU execution.
We have tested GPU support on Nvidia, AMD and Apple GPUs.
Note that most Apple GPUs do not support `Float64`.
See [below on how to run single precision simulations](@ref single_precision).

To run a simulation on a GPU, use the [`FullGridCellList`](@ref)
as cell list for the [`GridNeighborhoodSearch`](@ref).
Unlike the default cell list, which assumes an unbounded domain,
this cell list requires a bounding box for the domain.
For simulations that are bounded by a closed tank, we can simply use the boundary
of the tank to obtain the bounding box as follows.
```jldoctest gpu; output=false, setup=:(using TrixiParticles; trixi_include(@__MODULE__, joinpath(examples_dir(), "fluid", "hydrostatic_water_column_2d.jl"), sol=nothing))
min_corner = minimum(tank.boundary.coordinates, dims=2)
max_corner = maximum(tank.boundary.coordinates, dims=2)
cell_list = FullGridCellList(; min_corner, max_corner)

# output
FullGridCellList{PointNeighbors.DynamicVectorOfVectors{Int32, Matrix{Int32}, Vector{Int32}, Base.RefValue{Int32}}, Nothing, SVector{2, Float64}, SVector{2, Float64}}(Vector{Int32}[], nothing, [-0.12500000000000003, -0.12500000000000003], [1.125, 1.125])
```

We then need to pass this cell list to the neighborhood search and the neighborhood search
to the [`Semidiscretization`](@ref).
```jldoctest gpu; output=false
semi = Semidiscretization(fluid_system, boundary_system,
                          neighborhood_search=GridNeighborhoodSearch{2}(; cell_list))

# output
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Semidiscretization                                                                               │
│ ══════════════════                                                                               │
│ #spatial dimensions: ………………………… 2                                                                │
│ #systems: ……………………………………………………… 2                                                                │
│ neighborhood search: ………………………… GridNeighborhoodSearch                                           │
│ total #particles: ………………………………… 636                                                              │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

At this point, we should run the simulation and make sure that it still works and that
the bounding box is large enough.
For some simulations where particles move outside the initial tank coordinates,
for example when the tank is not closed or when the tank is moving, an appropriate
bounding box has to be specified.

Then, we only need to specify the parallelization backend that is used for the simulation.
On an Nvidia GPU, we specify:
```julia
using CUDA
semi = Semidiscretization(fluid_system, boundary_system,
                          neighborhood_search=GridNeighborhoodSearch{2}(; cell_list),
                          parallelization_backend=CUDABackend())
```
On an AMD GPU, we use:
```julia
using AMDGPU
semi = Semidiscretization(fluid_system, boundary_system,
                          neighborhood_search=GridNeighborhoodSearch{2}(; cell_list),
                          parallelization_backend=ROCBackend())
```
Now, we can run the simulation as usual.
All data is transferred to the GPU during initialization and all loops over particles
and their neighbors will be executed on the GPU as kernels generated by KernelAbstractions.jl.
Data is only copied to the CPU for saving VTK files via the [`SolutionSavingCallback`](@ref).

## Run an existing example file on the GPU

The example file `examples/fluid/dam_break_2d_gpu.jl` demonstrates how to run an existing
example file on a GPU.
It first loads the variables from `examples/fluid/dam_break_2d.jl` without executing
the simulation. This is achieved by overwriting the line that starts the simulation
with `trixi_include(..., sol=nothing)`.
Next, a GPU-compatible neighborhood search is defined, and the original example file
is included with the new neighborhood search.
This requires the assignments `neighborhood_search = ...` and `parallelization_backend = ...`
to be present in the original example file.
Note that in `examples/fluid/dam_break_2d.jl`, we explicitly set
`parallelization_backend=true`, even though this is the default value,
so that we can use `trixi_include` to replace this value.

To run this simulation on a GPU, simply update `parallelization_backend` to match the
array type of the installed GPU.
We can run this simulation on an Nvidia GPU as follows.
```julia
using CUDA
trixi_include(joinpath(examples_dir(), "fluid", "dam_break_2d_gpu.jl"), parallelization_backend=CUDABackend())
```
For AMD GPUs, use
```julia
using AMDGPU
trixi_include(joinpath(examples_dir(), "fluid", "dam_break_2d_gpu.jl"), parallelization_backend=ROCBackend())
```
For Apple GPUs (which don't support double precision, see below), use
```julia
using Metal
trixi_include_changeprecision(Float32,
                              joinpath(examples_dir(), "fluid", "dam_break_2d_gpu.jl"),
                              parallelization_backend=MetalBackend())
```

## [Single precision simulations](@id single_precision)

All GPU-supported features can also be used with single precision,
which is significantly faster on most GPUs and required for many Apple GPUs.

To run a simulation with single precision, all `Float64` literals in an example file
must be converted to `Float32` (e.g. `0.0` to `0.0f0`).
TrixiParticles provides a function to automate this conversion:
```@docs
trixi_include_changeprecision
```

To run the previous example with single precision, use the following:
```julia
using CUDA
trixi_include_changeprecision(Float32,
                              joinpath(examples_dir(), "fluid", "dam_break_2d_gpu.jl"),
                              parallelization_backend=CUDABackend())
```
